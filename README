# ☁️ Cloud & IoT Journey

Welcome to my **Cloud & IoT Journey**, a 13-week exploration of modern cloud concepts, infrastructure, and Internet-of-Things integration.  
This repository documents my progress in the **Cloud Computing** course at **Braude College**, including theory notes, practical setups, demos, and weekly reflections.

## 🎯 Goal
To build end-to-end expertise in Cloud Computing and IoT systems, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on cloud architecture, AI integration, and service deployment.

Over 13 weeks, this journey progresses from cloud foundations to AI-driven microservices, teaching how to connect sensors, process data in the cloud, and deploy intelligent IoT solutions.
The program blends Firebase, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, Flask, Docker, and LangChain—culminating in a self-built Smart IoT Cloud System.

By the end of this journey, I aim to:
  🌩️ Master cloud fundamentals: JSON, APIs, and cloud models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS).
  🌐 Implement IoT data flow: Connect MQTT sensors, collect and visualize live data.
  🔥 Build real cloud apps: Create Firebase dashboards and small Flask microservices.
  🧠 Integrate AI services: Add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LLM tools into cloud microservices.
  🧩 Apply software architecture: Use SOA and microservices patterns with Docker and APIs.
  📊 Handle big data: Store and analyze sensor data in BigQuery / Pandas pipelines.
  🤖 Develop intelligent agents: Build a digital twin dashboard and AI agent for IoT control.
  🔒 Understand privacy & ethics: Add user analytics with anonymization and GDPR compliance.
  🚀 Deliver a final project: The Smart IoT Cloud System — integrating sensors, Firebase, RAG, and agents into one cohesive platform.

Throughout the journey, I’ll publish weekly progress on GitHub and share project milestones on LinkedIn.
